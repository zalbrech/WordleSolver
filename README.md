# WordleSolver
World Solver is a console application that will help you solve the popular game Wordle with a 99.5% success rate!

Currently, there are 12 solutions that it cannot find:

1) boxer
2) daunt
3) hatch
4) hilly
5) might
6) patty
7) pound
8) shame
9) stack
10) waste
11) watch
12) wound

I am currently working on implementing a Linked List structure where each starting node will contain an ideally optimal guess for all possible board states
